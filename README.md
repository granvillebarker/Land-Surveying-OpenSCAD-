# Land-Surveying-OpenSCAD-
OpenSCAD file I created to subdivide some land.   A few helper functions are included.

I have some land with a pond, and wanted to see how many 1 acre lots would fit around the pond, so I started playing with OpenSCAD.   I added and borrowed a few functions to generate property descriptions from the lot vectors.
